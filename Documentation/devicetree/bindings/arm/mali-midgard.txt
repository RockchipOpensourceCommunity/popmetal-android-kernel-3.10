Example for a Mali-T76x:

gpu{
	compatible = "arm,malit764", 
				 "arm,malit76x", 
				 "arm,malit7xx", 
				 "arm,mali-midgard";
	reg = <0xffa30000 0x10000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 6 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>, 
				 <GIC_SPI 7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>, 
				 <GIC_SPI 8 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	interrupt-names = "JOB",
