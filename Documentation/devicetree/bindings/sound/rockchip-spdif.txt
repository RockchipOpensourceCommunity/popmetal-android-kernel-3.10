* Rockchip SPDIF controller

Required SoC Specific Properties:

- compatible : "rockchip-spdif"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
  clock-names property.
- clocks-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks
  property. Must contain "spdif_mclk" and "spdif_hclk".
- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
- dmas: list of DMA controller phandle and DMA request line ordered pairs.
- dma-names: identifier string for each DMA request line in the dmas property.
  These strings correspond 1:1 with the ordered pairs in dmas.
- pinctrl-names: must contain a "default" entry.
- pinctrl-0: pin control group to be used for this controller.
- pinctrl-1: pin control group to be used for gpio.

Example:

spdif: spdif@10204000 {
	compatible = "rockchip-spdif";
	reg = <0x10204000 0x1000>;
	clocks = <&clk_spdif>, <&clk_gates10 8>;
	clock-names = "spdif_mclk", "spdif_hclk";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 55 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	dmas = <&pdma 13>;
	dma-names = "tx";
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&spdif_tx>;
};
