* Rockchip I2S controller

Required SoC Specific Properties:

- compatible : "rockchip-i2s"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- i2s-id: i2s controller id,
- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
  clock-names property.
- clocks-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks
  property. Must contain "i2s_clk" and "i2s_hclk".
- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
- dmas: list of DMA controller phandle and DMA request line ordered pairs.
- dma-names: identifier string for each DMA request line in the dmas property.
  These strings correspond 1:1 with the ordered pairs in dmas.
- pinctrl-names: must contain a "default" entry.
- pinctrl-0: pin control group to be used for this controller.
- pinctrl-1: pin control group to be used for gpio.

Example:

i2s0: i2s@10220000 {
	compatible = "rockchip-i2s";
	reg = <0x10220000 0x1000>;
	i2s-id = <0>;
	clocks = <&clk_i2s_2ch>, <&clk_i2s_2ch_out>, <&clk_gates7 2>;
	clock-names = "i2s_clk", "i2s_mclk", "i2s_hclk";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 19 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	dmas = <&pdma 0>, <&pdma 1>;
	dma-names = "tx", "rx";
	pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
	pinctrl-0 = <&i2s0_mclk &i2s0_sclk &i2s0_lrckrx &i2s0_lrcktx &i2s0_sdi &i2s0_sdo>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&i2s0_gpio>;
};
